**Statistical Analysis**

**Use your data to determine whether the mean or the median better summarizes the data.**

Based on the data mean summarize the data more meaningfully. By adding up each baker's count and dividing the result by the total count, we may finish our data with a more precise amount using this method.

**Use your data to determine if there is more variability with successful or unsuccessful campaigns. Does this make sense? Why or why not?**

There is higher variability in a successful group than the failed group. It has a larger number of mean value.
